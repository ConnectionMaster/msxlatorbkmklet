# msxlatorbkmklet
Microsoft / Bing Translator Bookmarklet
Since Microsoft has removed their bookmarklet for their Microsoft Translator, which is also used by Bing, I created this simple bookmarklet that does the same thing.
javascript:void(window.open('http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=&to=en&a='+location.href));
